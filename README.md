  AAMP and ACAMP Algorithms </p>
<h1> Quick-Matrix-Profile </h1>   <br/> 

We propose efficient algorithms for computing matrix profile for a general class of Euclidean distances. We first propose a simple but efficient algorithm called AAMP for computing matrix profile with the classical (non-normalized) Euclidean distance. 

Then, we extend our algorithm for the p-norm distance. We also propose two algorithms called ACAMP and ACAMP-Optimized that use the same principle as AAMP, but for calculating matrix profile by using z-normalized Euclidean distance

To show the better outlier detection capabilities of AAMP and ACAMP over STOMP algorithm on ECG dataset:
```matlab
-- ECG_Journal_Exp.m
```

To show the better outlier detection capabilities of AAMP and ACAMP over STOMP algorithm on Seismic dataset:
```matlab
-- IGS_Work.m
```
Compute the change in :
* Comutational time with the increase of sub-sequence length i.e. m. 
* Comutational time with the increase of time series length i.e. n 

```matlab
-- test_AAMP_subSeq.m
-- test_AAMP_SeriesLen.m
```

Here, we can obtain the computational time of the following algorithms : 
  1. STOMP
  2. SCRIMP
  3. SCRIMP++
  4. AAMP
  5. ACAMP
  6. ACAMP Optimized
